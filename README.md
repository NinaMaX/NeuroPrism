## The Problem

![Untitled](https://www.geniuswithin.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Venn_Genius-Within-V1-1024x768.png)

According to [a Forbes article by Nancy Doyle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drnancydoyle/2022/01/14/adhd-crisis-in-the-uk-under-diagnosed-lacking-support-and-stigmatized/?sh=388a920196f4), there is an ADHD crisis in the UK where is it underdiagnosed, lacking support and stigmatised. With my personal experience, I can testify to the lack of clear diagnosis pathways and support for ADHD, particularly for women and girls. Dr Rob Baskind, a Consultant Psychiatrist, reports the extent of the crisis:

*"The prevalence of ADHD in adults is widely reported as between 2.5%-4%, although this is felt to be a conservative figure. Only approximately 10-20% of individuals with ADHD will be treated."*

Unsurprisingly, this issue is not unique to the UK or to ADHD. According to Forbes and Harvard Business Review respectively, [autistic people struggle with employment in the US](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbernick/2021/01/12/the-state-of-autism-employment-in-2021/?sh=52b8a06a59a4) and [systemic discrimination holds them back at work](https://hbr.org/2021/12/autism-doesnt-hold-people-back-at-work-discrimination-does) despite research and data showing that [neurodiversity is a competitive advantage in the workforce](https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage) that [benefits everyone](https://theconversation.com/neurodiversity-at-work-benefits-everyone-why-companies-are-hiring-autistic-people-146788). According to the BBC, it is estimated that [around one in seven people are neurodivergent yet only 16% of autistic adults are in full-time employment in the UK](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190719-neurodiversity) and [in the US, the unemployment of the neurodiverse population runs as high as 80%](https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage).

Neurodiverse individuals are often [economically and socially isolated](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/clearing-up-some-misconceptions-about-neurodiversity/), and [the ongoing pandemic only exasperated the severity of the challenges and struggles, including increased rates of depression and anxiety](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-neurodivergence-impacts-experiences-of-the-pandemic-5186107). [20 to 30% of male adults on the spectrum have anxiety disorder, whereas the prevalence of anxiety is up to 40% in females on the spectrum](https://med.stanford.edu/psychiatry/about/covid19/neurodiverse.html).

## The Solution

NeuroPrism is an online community and social media platform for diagnosed and undiagnosed neurodiverse individuals and their families and friends to learn, share, thrive and inspire. The current prototype is an iOS app, but it can be easily adapted to other operating systems as well as the web.

The platform consists of four main services and pillars:

- **Learn** - raise awareness and dispel misconceptions around neurodiversity through the latest scientific research and clinical guidance
- **Share** - offer practical tips and advice and recommend tested tools and techniques to effectively manage and take control of neurodiverse conditions
- **Thrive** - create a safe space and build an inclusive and welcoming community to ask questions, share experiences and support each other
- **Inspire** - meet neurodiverse role models across different fields, hear their stories and be inspired by their journeys

The mobile app enables users to access the platform anytime and anywhere and be instantly connected to the supportive and informative community. The platform incorporates accessible technology, behavioural technology, medical technology, audiovisual media, artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide an optimal user experience. It is seamlessly integrated with other applications and platforms and allows users to easily transition between interfaces.

## The Audience

The solution primarily serves the neurodiverse community but also their families and friends and those who work and/or are interested in neurodiversity. Neurodivergent conditions include but are not limited to:

Those with neurodivergent conditions are [more at risk of suffering from mental illnesses or poor wellbeing](https://www.healthassured.org/blog/neurodiversity/). This is often due to a lack of support, and the strain of faking normality, or 'masking', can lead to depression, stress and burnout. [ADHD and autism are also underdiagnosed in women and ethnic minorities,](https://www.inclusiveemployers.co.uk/neurodiversity-in-the-workplace-understanding-is-key/) where the intersectionality creates layered inequality. Many services only work with children, so there is limited support for neurodivergent adults, both pre- and post-diagnosis.

## Stage of Development

I am still at the concept stage and exploring the idea for its feasibility to build hte product. I have designed the wireframe of the app with multiple iterations through ongoing user research, but I have yet to produce an MVP.

## Core Technologies

The project is a mobile app to be extended to a web solution that incorporates the following technologies:

- **Accessible technology** - I want to make sure every user can navigate through the app without difficulties and have a smooth and enjoyable user experience, which is why the app is designed with accessibility every step of the way.
    - Customisable interface - there are pre-made themes designed in particular with dyslexia in mind, but users are also able to change the individual formatting metrics of the app interface, including background colour, font size and colour, text density, etc.
    - Speech recognition - an AI voice assistant is fully integrated into the app. This not only catered to users with visual impairments but also those with severe dyslexia who can struggle with writing down, but not verbally expressing, multiple ideas.
    - Other accessible features include [immersive reader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHJJCLV-DNg), [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader), text translation, [text suggestion](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-text-suggestions-in-windows-0bf313ca-c992-4173-aa5f-8341d3953498), etc.
- **Behavioural technology** - in the Thrive section of the app, we have curated a list of third-party apps and tools utilising [behavioural change technology](https://www.appliedbehavioranalysisedu.org/what-is-behavioral-change-technology/) that are fully integrated into the platform.
- **Medical technology**
    - Verified medical professionals are able to offer pro bono advice.
    - Users can access assessment tools such as [the QbTest](https://www.qbtech.com/) for ADHD.
- **Audiovisual media** - all video and audio contents are transcribed to be accessible by users with hearing impairments.
- **Machine learning** the app uses a recommender system based on machine learning that can curate and recommend personalised content most relevant for users to consume.
